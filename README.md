UART | One of the most often used communication protocols in embedded systems is UART.<br /> UART turns the parallel data it receives into a serial bit stream of data that is potentially easier to interact with.<br /> It is used for shell access and a favorite interface of any hardware hacker.<br />[Abusing UART](https://www.ethicalhacker.net/columns/sindermann/hardware-hacking-101-lesson-3-abusing-uart-u-are-root/)
JTAG | From the perspective of a hacker, JTAG serves a variety of functions, including the ability to read/write data, debug running processes, and change the code execution flow.<br />[JTAG Explained](https://blog.senr.io/blog/jtag-explained)
SPI & I2C | SPI & I2C both are a serial communication protocol that is commonly used in Flash and EEPROM. We can dump data from it because it includes storage, which might include firmware, hardcoded keys, and other sensitive information, depending on type of target we have.<br />[Dumping Your First Firmware](https://blog.nvisium.com/intro-to-hardware-hacking-dumping-your-first-firmware)
